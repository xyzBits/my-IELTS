# Test 01-Passage 1: Johnsons's Dictionary 

## p1
 For the century before Johnson's Dictionary was published in 1775, 
there had been concern about the state of the English language. 

There was no standard way of speaking or writing and no argeement 
as to the best way of bringing some order to the chaos of English spelling. 

Dr. Johnson privided the solution.

- "as to the best way of bringing some order to the chaos of English spelling" 是一个介词短语引导的从句，用来说明前面提到的 "no agreement" 的具体内容

## p2
There had, of course, been dictionaries in the past, 
the first of these being a little book of some 120 pages, 
compiled by a certain Robert Cawdray, 
published 1604 under the title A Table Alphabeticall 'of hard unusuall English Works'.

Like the various dictionaries that came after it during the seventeenth century, 
Cawdray's tended to concentrate on 'scholarly' words; 
one function of dictionary was to enable its student to convey and impression of fine learning.




## p3
Beyond the practical need to make order out of chaos, 
the rise of dictionaries is associated with the rise of the English middle class, 
who were anxious to define and circumscribe the various worlds to conquer-lexical 
as well as social and commerical. 

It is highly appropriate that Dr Samuel Johnson, 
the very model of an eighteenth-century literary man, 
as famous in his own times as in ours, 
should have pulished his Dictionary at the very beginning of the heyday of the middle class.

- "as well as" 与 "and" 都可以用来连接两个并列的成分，但它们在用法上略有不同。

- "And" 更常用于连接同类或相似的成分，表示简单的并列关系。
- "As well as" 则更常用于连接具有不同属性或性质的成分，强调两者的补充或增强关系。
在给定的句子中，使用 "as well as" 更具体地强调了与前面提到的“lexical”相对应的“social and commercial”这两个属性，
表明中产阶级不仅有关于词汇领域的目标，还有社会和商业领域的目标。因此，这里选择使用 "as well as" 更准确地传达了作者的意图。

- 在这个句子中，连字符 "-" 用来连接形容词 "lexical"、"social" 和 "commercial" 与名词 "worlds"，形成复合形容词短语 "lexical worlds"、"social worlds" 和 "commercial worlds"。
这种使用连字符表示这些形容词与名词之间存在一种紧密的关系，用来修饰名词 "worlds"，表示这些世界在不同领域或方面上需要被征服或征服。
