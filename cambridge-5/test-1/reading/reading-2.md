# Passage 2: Nature or Nurture?

## p1

A few years ago, in one of the most fascinating and disturbing experiments in behavioral psychology,
Stanly Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects from all walks of life for their willingness 
to obey istructions given by a 'leader' in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal 
distaste for the actions they were called up to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer
'teacher-subject' that the experiment was i the noble cause of education, and was designed test whether
not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn.
