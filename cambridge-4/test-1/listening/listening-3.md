Excuse me, Dr Johnson. May I speak to you for a minute?


Sure. Come in.

I'm Melanie Griffin. I'm taking your course in Polulation Studies.

Right. Well, Melanie, how can I help you?

I'm ... having a bit of trouble with the second assignment, and it's due in twelve days.

What sort of trouble are you having? Is the assignment question a problem?

Well, that's part of the problem.

 I'm also having-been having-trouble getting hold of the book. 

I've been to the library several times, and all the books are out.

Sounds like you should have started borrowing books a bit earlier.

Well, I had a really big assignment due in for another course, and I've been spending all my time on that, and I thought ...

If that's possible, but I don't know...

Well, yes, it is possible, but extensions are normally given only for medical or compassionate reasons, 

otherwise it's really a question of organising your study, and we don't like giving extensions to students who simply didn't plan their work properly.

What did you get for your first assignment?

I got eighty-seven per cent.

Mmm, yes, you did very well indeed, so obviously you can produce good work.

I don't think I'll need too much extra time, as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.

Well, since you did so well in your first assignment, I'm prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one, so that'll mean you'll need to submit it about a month from now.

Thank you.

Now, what about the rading materials?

Have you checked out the journal articles in the list?

Umm, on, not yet, there were about twenty of them, and I wasn't sure which ones would be most useful or important.

Well, They're all usefull, but I don't expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues.

Let me give you some suggestions.

The article by Anderson and Hawker is really worth reading.

Right, I'll read that one.

You should also read the article by Jackson, but just look at the part on the research methodology-how they did it.

OK... Jackson, got that...

And if you have time, the one by Roberts says very relevant things, although it's not essential.

So, OK, if it's useful, I'll try and read that one...

Now, the only by Morris. I wouldn't bother with that at this stage, if I were you.

OK, I won't bother with Morris. Oh, now, someone told me that the article by Cooper is important.

Well, yes, in a way, but just look at the last part, where he discussed the research results.

And lastly, there's Forster-I can't think why I included that one. It's not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.

Now, let's deal with the assignment question. What's the problem there?

It's the graph on page two. 

What seems to be the problem? It's just the bar graph showing reasons why people change where they live.

Well, I've got a photocopy but the reasons at the bottom are missing.

OK. Looking at the first bar on the graph-now that indicates the number of people who move because they want more space.

Oh I see... bar one. Ok ... Now what about the next bar?
