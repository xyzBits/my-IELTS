You'll hear a tour guide giving a talk about museum center called RiverSide Industrial Village.

Fist, you have some time to look at questions eleven to thirteen.

Now listen carefully and answer questions eleven to thirteen.

Good afternoon everybody and welcome to Riverside Industrial Village.

To start your visit, I'm going to give a brief account of the history of the museum before letting you roam about on your own.

I won't keep you long, OK?

Now from where you're standing you've got a good view of the river over there.

And it was because of fast-flowing water that the site was a natural place for manufacturing works.

The water, and the availability of the raw materials in  the area like minerals and iron ore, and also the abundance of local fuels, like coal
and firewood,

all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time.

Water was the main source of power for the early industries and some of
the water wheels were first established in the twelfth century, would you believe?

At that time, local craftsman fist built an iron forge just behind the village here, on the bend in the river.

By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the region's rivers
supported more a hundred and sixty water mills

and many of these continued to operate well into the nineteenth century.

But then the steam engine was invented and the railways came and the
centers of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the
countryside and into the towns.

So, industrial villages like this one became very rare.

If you'd like any more information, you can ask me some questions, 
or you can read further in our excellent guide book.

Now I'm going to give you a plan the of sie and I'd just like to point
out where everything is and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.

I've already pointed out the river, which is on the left.

And of course, running along the bottom is Woodside Road, got it?

Ok. Now we're standing at the entrance, see it at the bottom, and
immediately to our right is the Ticket Office.

They won't need that because you've got your group booking, but just
pass it are the toilet-always good to know where they are.

In front of use is the car park, you can see, and to the left, by the
entry gate is the Gift Shop.

That's where you can get copies of the guide, like this one here.

Now, beyond the car park all the buildings are arranged in a half circle
with a ard in the middle.

The big, stone building at the top is the main Workshop.

That's where the furnace is and where all the metal was smelted
and the tools were cast, as you'll be able to see.

Now, in the top right-hand corner, that building with bigger windows
is the Showroom, where samples of all the tools that were made
through the ages are on display.

In the top left corner is the Grinding Shop, where the tools were
sharpened and finished.

And on one side of that you can see the Engine Room and on the other
is the Cafe.

which isn't an antique, you'll be pleased to know, though they do
server very nice old-fashioned teas.

The row of buildings you can see on the left are the cottages.

These were built for the workers towards the end of the eighteenth
century

and they're still furnished from that period so you can get a good 
idea of ordinary people's living conditions.

Across the yard from them, you can see the stables where the horses
were kept for transporting the products.

And the separate building in front of them is the Works Office and that
still has some of the old accounts on display.

Right, if anyone want a guided tour then I'am staring at the Engine Room.

If you'd like to come along, this way please, ladies and gentlemen.
