Adults and children are frequently confronted with statement about the alarming rate of loss of tropical rainforests.

For example, one graphic illustration to which children might readily relate is the estimate that rainforests are 
being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one thousand football fields every forty minutes-about the duration of a normal 
classroom period.

In the face of the frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that children will have formed ideas about rainforests
-what and where they are, why they are important, what endangers them-independent of any formal tuition. 

It is also possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken.
